Always reference the documentation in /documentation/Full_PID/00-project-initiation/ before suggesting new features. Adhere strictly to the 'Definition of Done' and 'Scope' defined in 01_Project-Charter.md.

Always consider and factor into your thinking the changes since the PID documents were created,  all changes are recorded and available as a single json object in documentation/Full_PID/00-project-initiation/CHANGELOG.md

Always consider installed libraries before installing new ones.

NEVER allow a installed library to be used if it has any npm critical vulnerabilites OR warnings about memory leakage.

Always do a full update for each atomic change (update the json and markdown table) in documentation/Full_PID/00-project-initiation/CHANGELOG.md

Always draft a ~50 commit msg when changes are finished and remind human to commit.  Display draft and reminder in the console where the prompt was entered (do NOT create a file for it)
