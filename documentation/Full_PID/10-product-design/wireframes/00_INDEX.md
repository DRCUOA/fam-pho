# Product Design / Wireframes — Index

**Purpose:** UI flow and screen concepts for *fam-pho* across mobile/desktop viewports.

## Read first (recommended order)
1. Start with the high-level flow: **Home / Workflow**
   - [Workflow.html](fam-pho-d1-simpleMobile-fullscreens/5-Photo Archive - Home/Workflow.html)
2. Then walk the core lifecycle screens:
   - [Triage Queue](fam-pho-d1-simpleMobile-fullscreens/1-Photo Archive - Triage Queue.html)
   - [Search](fam-pho-d1-simpleMobile-fullscreens/2-Photo Archive - Search.html)
   - [Upload](fam-pho-d1-simpleMobile-fullscreens/3-Photo Archive - Upload.html)
   - [Metadata Entry](fam-pho-d1-simpleMobile-fullscreens/8-Photo Archive - Metadata Entry.html)

## Notes
- Wireframes communicate **interaction intent**, not final visuals.
- If a wireframe implies a feature, confirm it exists in:
  - `documentation/00-project-initiation/02_Requirements.md`
  - `documentation/00-project-initiation/03_Epics-and-Roadmap.md`

## Other viewports
See `otherviewports/` ZIP exports for alternate device layouts and comparisons.
