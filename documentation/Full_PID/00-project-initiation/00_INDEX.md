# Project Initiation — Index

**Purpose:** Establish the “why/what” for *fam-pho* (Family Photo Archive): goals, scope, requirements, and delivery plan.

## Read first (recommended order)
1. [01_Project-Charter.md](01_Project-Charter.md) — problem statement, goals/non-goals, success criteria
2. [02_Requirements.md](02_Requirements.md) — functional + non-functional requirements (security, performance, backup)
3. [03_Epics-and-Roadmap.md](03_Epics-and-Roadmap.md) — MVP scope and epic sequencing

## When to use this folder
- Starting work on a new feature (confirm it maps to an epic + requirements)
- Reviewing scope creep (check goals/non-goals and MVP boundary)
- Aligning “Definition of Done” and acceptance expectations

## Canonical source rule
This folder is the **source of truth** for *project intent and scope*. If something conflicts with wireframes/data-model, update initiation docs first.
